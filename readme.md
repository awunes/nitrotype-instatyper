# NitroType InstaTyper

This is an instant typer script for NitroType. I made this for fun so don't expect frequent updates, although if its broken, open a PR or issue. It uses a userscript to send data to an AutoHotKey script to press keys.

### **YOU MAY GET BANNED FROM NITROTYPE - I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT YOU DO WITH THIS SCRIPT**

## Install Instructions

To use this tool, you must install the [userscript](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/420462-nitrotype-instatyper). This will allow communication with the AHK script.
You then can download the latest EXE file, or install [AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) and run the .ahk file yourself.

If you want to exit the script, right click the **H** in your taskbar and click _Exit_.
