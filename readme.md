# NitroType InstaTyper

This is an instant typer script for NitroType. I made this for fun so don't expect frequent updates, although if its broken, open a PR or issue. It uses a userscript to send data to an AutoHotKey script to press keys.

It's windows only sorry.

### **YOU MAY GET BANNED FROM NITROTYPE - I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT YOU DO WITH THIS SCRIPT**

## Install Instructions

To use this tool, you must install the [userscript](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/420462-nitrotype-instatyper). This will allow communication with the AHK script.
You then can download the latest EXE file, or install [AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) and run the .ahk file yourself. The AHK file will type for you.

You must use BOTH the userscript and AHK file in order for this tool to work. The AHK script is designed to run in the background without interference.

If you want to exit the script, right click the **H** in your taskbar and click _Exit_.

**You can not minimize the window while the script is typing. If you want to cancel the typing, exit/reload the script.**

## Features
